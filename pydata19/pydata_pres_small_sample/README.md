# AB-testing on a small number of clusters
## PyData London 2019 - Tutorial

This repository contains a presentation tutorial drafted for [PyData London 2019](https://pydata.org/london2019/schedule/presentation/24/). We look into AB-testing, also known as Randomised-control trials (RCT) â€” notably issues raised by testing on small samples. We consider testing under constraints, typically having to segment users along groups or clusters of users.

### Stucture

This presentation covers principles of AB-tests, how to compute AA-tests and sensitivity tests and how to interpret insights from them. We then investigate complications from constraints. The most common type  restriction is that users belonging to a same group have to be exposed to the same experience, therefore in the same segment (known as Control and Treatment). This _de facto_ reduces the size of the sample to the number of clusters.  We consider the impact of testing on a sample of small size throughout.

The repository uses a table of `events` and `segment` randomly generated to illustrate our points. However, we encourage people to use their own dataset to understand how tests could work on their own data.
